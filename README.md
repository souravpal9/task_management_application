2. Task Management Application
Overview
A Task Management Application helps users organize and track their tasks or to-do items. It includes features for task creation, updating, and tracking.

Key Components
Task Model

Functionality: Represents individual tasks with attributes such as title, description, and status.
Technologies: Java and Hibernate for modeling.
Sample Code:

java
Copy code
@Entity
public class Task {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String title;
    private String description;
    private String status; // e.g., "Pending", "In Progress", "Completed"
    // Getters and setters
}
CRUD Operations

Functionality: Create, read, update, and delete tasks.
Technologies: Spring Data JPA for data persistence.
Sample Code:

java
Copy code
@Service
public class TaskService {
    @Autowired
    private TaskRepository taskRepository;

    public List<Task> getAllTasks() {
        return taskRepository.findAll();
    }

    public Task createTask(Task task) {
        return taskRepository.save(task);
    }

    public Task updateTask(Long id, Task taskDetails) {
        Task task = taskRepository.findById(id).orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("Task not found"));
        task.setTitle(taskDetails.getTitle());
        task.setDescription(taskDetails.getDescription());
        task.setStatus(taskDetails.getStatus());
        return taskRepository.save(task);
    }

    public void deleteTask(Long id) {
        Task task = taskRepository.findById(id).orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("Task not found"));
        taskRepository.delete(task);
    }
}
RESTful APIs

Functionality: Endpoints for task management operations.
Technologies: Spring Boot for creating RESTful services.
Sample Code:

java
Copy code
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/tasks")
public class TaskController {
    @Autowired
    private TaskService taskService;

    @GetMapping
    public List<Task> getAllTasks() {
        return taskService.getAllTasks();
    }

    @PostMapping
    public Task createTask(@RequestBody Task task) {
        return taskService.createTask(task);
    }

    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public Task updateTask(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Task task) {
        return taskService.updateTask(id, task);
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<Void> deleteTask(@PathVariable Long id) {
        taskService.deleteTask(id);
        return ResponseEntity.noContent().build();
    }
}
Frontend

Functionality: Display tasks and interact with the backend.
Technologies: Thymeleaf for server-side rendering or React for a more interactive UI.
Sample Thymeleaf Template:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
<head>
    <title>Task Management</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Tasks</h1>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Title</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Status</th>
        </tr>
        <tr th:each="task : ${tasks}">
            <td th:text="${task.title}"></td>
            <td th:text="${task.description}"></td>
            <td th:text="${task.status}"></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</body>
</html>
Sample React Component:

javascript
Copy code
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function TaskList() {
    const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);

    useEffect(() => {
        fetch('/api/tasks')
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => setTasks(data));
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Tasks</h1>
            <ul>
                {tasks.map(task => (
                    <li key={task.id}>
                        <h2>{task.title}</h2>
                        <p>{task.description}</p>
                        <p>Status: {task.status}</p>
                    </li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
}

export default TaskList;
